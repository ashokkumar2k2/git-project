    <h1>Telegram</h1>
<p>
    Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.
    SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. 
     Telegram apps are standalone, so you don't need to keep your phone connected.Telegram Messenger, commonly known as Telegram, is a cloud-based, cross-platform, instant messaging (IM) service. It was originally launched for iOS on 14 August 2013 and Android on 20 October 2013. It allows users to exchange messages, share media and files, and hold private and group voice or video calls as well as public livestreams. It is available for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and web browsers. Telegram also offers end-to-end encryption in voice and video calls,[10] and in optional private chats, which Telegram calls Secret Chats</p>

     <h2>Development</h2>
     <p>Telegram was launched in 2013 by the brothers Nikolai and Pavel Durov. Previously, the pair founded the Russian social network VK, which they left in 2014, saying it had been taken over by the government.[22] Pavel sold his remaining stake in VK and left Russia after resisting government pressure.[23] Nikolai created the MTProto protocol that is the basis for the messenger, while Pavel provided financial support and infrastructure through his Digital Fortress fund.[24] Telegram Messenger states that its end goal is not to bring profit,[25][26] but it is not structured as a non-profit organization</p>

     <h3>Messaging</h3>
     <p><strong><em>To start using Telegram,</em></strong> a user must sign-up with their phone number or an anonymous +888 number purchased from the Fragment &nbsp; blockchain platform.[56][57] Changing the phone number in the app will automatically reassign the user's account to that number without the need to export data or notify their contacts.[56][58][59] Phone numbers are hidden by default with only a user's contacts being able to see them. Sign-ups can only be done via an Android or iOS device.[60][61] Upon signing up, messages sent and received by the user are tied to their number and a custom username,[62] not the device. Any Telegram content is synced between the user's logged-in devices automatically through cloud storage, except for device-specific secret chats. By default, any account that is inactive for 6 months by default is automatically deleted, though the period can be shortened or extended up to 12 months through the Settings menu. Telegram allows groups, bots and channels with a verified social media or Wikipedia page to be verified, but not individual user accounts &lt; Telegram  &gt; </p>
